 Chapter 1:​ The basics of machine learning
 1.​1 What is machine learning?​
 2.2 Machine learning represents the Technology itself:All pratices and set of tools to give the computer the ability to find a pattern without explicitly programmed 

 This includes the  different type of machine learning and algorithms such as supervised learning , naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and so on that we will cover in next few chappter.
 This means that the technology is used to train the computer to make thier own prediction  based on a developped understanding of historical data

What This means that we are not telling the computer exactly what is to look for , instead, we feed algorithm a lot of data previously collected and let them find patterns and correlation in the dataset to draw the future conclusions probabilities when given new data

.What's the neural networks? Neural network are set of deep learning algorithms that designed  to mimic  the way brain works
The way same way  the brain is  made of a giant Networks connected neurons
Neurals NetWork are made of layers  interconnected node called Artificial neurons
