        What is machine learning? ML represents the technology itself: all the practices and the set of tools that enable computers to find patterns in data
        without being explicitly programmed. This includes different types of learning and algorithms available, such as supervised learning, naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and so on.

    <p>
        Neural networks are sets of deep learning algorithms designed to mimic the way the brain works.

    <h4>Type of Machine Learning</h4>
    <div>
        <h5>Supervised Learning</h5>
        <p>Supervised learning refers to the task of training a model using labeled examples. The model learns from input-output pairs and can make predictions on new, unseen data.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Unsupervised Learning</h5>
        <p>Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data. The model learns patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without any explicit labels or outputs.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Reinforcement Learning</h5>
        <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of learning where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions or take actions to maximize rewards or minimize penalties.</p>
